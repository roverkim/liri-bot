# LIRI
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


## Usage
Within bash, type `node liri.js` or `node liri.js <LIRI Command>`

LIRI takes in 4 basic commands which performs 4 different tasks

* `my-tweets` Shows a user's Tweets.
* `spotify-this-song` Displays information of songs.
* `movie-this` Displays information of a Movie.
* `do-what-it-says` Picks a random command stored in a text file.

Basic error handling allows users to type the commands as `mytweets`, `MYTWEETS`, `my-TWEETS`, `my tweets`, `My Tweets`.

Other basic validations have been included to prevent invalid input. E.g: Typing an invalid command, typing a string instead of a number, etc...

**LIRI logs and saves user input in log.txt**
